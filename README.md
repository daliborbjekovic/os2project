# os2project
Process scheduler for a multi processor computer.
The task was to implement three different modes for a process scheduler: Completely fair, Multilevel feedback queue, Shortest job first.
I implemented the classes in com.etf.os2.project.scheduler( CFScheduler, MFQScheduler, SJFScheduler, Scheduler) and classes PCB and PCBData in com.etf.os2.project.process. The rest was already given by the proffessor so we could test our implementations.
